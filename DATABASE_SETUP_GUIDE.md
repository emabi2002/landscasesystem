# üìä Database Setup Guide - DLPP Legal Case Management System

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - You MUST Complete This Setup First!

The Legal Case Management System will **NOT work** until you complete these database setup steps. This guide will walk you through the entire process.

---

## Step 1: Access Your Supabase Project (2 minutes)

1. Open a web browser and go to **https://supabase.com**
2. Sign in with your Supabase account credentials:
   - Username: `lands`
   - Password: `eXtort1on001`
3. Once logged in, you should see your project with ID: `yvnkyjnwvylrweyzvibs`
4. Click on the project to enter the dashboard

---

## Step 2: Run the Database Schema (5 minutes)

### 2.1 Open SQL Editor
1. In the Supabase dashboard, look at the **left sidebar**
2. Click on **"SQL Editor"** (icon looks like </> )
3. Click the **"New query"** button at the top

### 2.2 Copy the Database Schema
1. Open the file `database-schema.sql` in this project
2. **Select ALL the text** in the file (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Copy** the entire content (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)

### 2.3 Execute the Schema
1. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Paste** all the copied SQL code into the editor
3. Click **"Run"** or press **Ctrl/Cmd + Enter**
4. Wait for the execution to complete (should take 10-30 seconds)
5. You should see a green message: **"Success. No rows returned"**

### ‚úÖ What This Creates:
- **10 database tables**: cases, parties, documents, tasks, events, land_parcels, case_history, evidence, notifications, profiles
- **Indexes** for fast queries
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data protection
- **Triggers** for automatic logging
- **Functions** for data validation

---

## Step 3: Create Your Admin User (3 minutes)

### 3.1 Create User in Authentication
1. In Supabase, click **"Authentication"** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **"Users"** tab
3. Click the green **"Add user"** button
4. Select **"Create new user"**
5. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Email: admin@lands.gov.pg
   Password: demo123
   Confirm Password: demo123
   ```
6. Click **"Create user"**

### 3.2 Copy the User ID
1. After creating the user, you'll see a list of users
2. Find the user you just created (`admin@lands.gov.pg`)
3. Look for the **"ID"** column - it's a long string like:
   ```
   a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
   ```
4. **Copy this entire ID** - you'll need it in the next step

---

## Step 4: Link User to Profile Table (2 minutes)

### 4.1 Run the Profile Insert Query
1. Go back to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New query"** to start fresh
3. Paste this SQL code, **BUT REPLACE** `YOUR_USER_ID` with the ID you copied:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID', 'admin@lands.gov.pg', 'System Administrator', 'admin');
```

**Example** (yours will have a different ID):
```sql
INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, email, full_name, role)
VALUES ('a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890', 'admin@lands.gov.pg', 'System Administrator', 'admin');
```

4. Click **"Run"**
5. You should see: **"Success. No rows returned"**

## Step 5: Load Sample Data (OPTIONAL - 3 minutes)

Want to see the system with realistic data immediately? Load our sample data!

### 5.1 Run Sample Data Script
1. In Supabase, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New query"**
3. Open the file `sample-data.sql` in this project
4. **Copy ALL** the SQL code
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click **"Run"**
7. Wait for completion (should take 10-20 seconds)

### ‚úÖ What This Creates:
- **5 User Profiles** - Legal officers, registrar, survey officer, director
