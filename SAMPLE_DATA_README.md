---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### UUIDs
The sample data uses placeholder UUIDs (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001, etc.)
- These work fine for testing
- For production, use actual user UUIDs from Supabase Auth
- Link real auth users to profiles table

### File Placeholders
Document and evidence URLs use `/placeholder/` paths
- These are for demonstration only
- In production, upload real files via the system
- Files will be stored in Supabase Storage

### Conflicts
The sample data uses `ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING` for profiles
- Safe to run multiple times
- Won't create duplicate entries
- Other tables will create new records each time
