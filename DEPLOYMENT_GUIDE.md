## üöÄ Deployment Steps (Netlify)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Repository (10 minutes)

1. **Create a GitHub Repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   # In your project directory
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - DLPP Legal CMS"

   # Create repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/dlpp-legal-cms.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Verify `.gitignore`** includes:
   ```
   .env.local
   .env*.local
   node_modules/
   .next/
   out/
   build/
   ```

3. **Check `netlify.toml`** (should already exist):
   ```toml
   [build]
   command = "bun run build"
   publish = ".next"

   [[plugins]]
   package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
   ```

### Step 2: Create Netlify Account (5 minutes)

1. Go to **https://www.netlify.com**
2. Click **"Sign up"**
3. Choose **"Sign up with GitHub"** (easiest)
4. Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
5. Complete your profile

### Step 3: Deploy to Netlify (10 minutes)

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Click **"Add new site"**
   - Choose **"Import an existing project"**
   - Select **"Deploy with GitHub"**

2. **Select Repository**:
   - Find and click your `dlpp-legal-cms` repository
   - Click **"Deploy"**

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `bun run build` (or `npm run build`)
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Click **"Show advanced"**

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   Click **"New variable"** and add:

   ```
   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   Value: https://yvnkyjnwvylrweyzvibs.supabase.co

   Key: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Use your PRODUCTION Supabase credentials, not development!

5. **Deploy**:
   - Click **"Deploy site"**
   - Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete
   - You'll see build logs in real-time

### Step 4: Verify Deployment (5 minutes)

1. **Once build succeeds**:
   - Netlify will show you the site URL (e.g., `random-name-12345.netlify.app`)
   - Click the URL to open your deployed site

2. **Test the deployment**:
   - [ ] Login page loads
   - [ ] Can login with admin credentials
   - [ ] Dashboard shows data
   - [ ] Can view cases
   - [ ] Can create new case
   - [ ] All features work

3. **If login fails**:
   - Check environment variables are set correctly
   - Verify Supabase URL and key
   - Check browser console for errors

### Step 5: Configure Custom Domain (Optional - 10 minutes)

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to **"Domain settings"**
   - Click **"Add custom domain"**
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `legal.lands.gov.pg`)

2. **Update DNS** (with your domain provider):
   - Add CNAME record pointing to your Netlify subdomain
   - Or use Netlify nameservers (recommended)

3. **Enable HTTPS**:
   - Netlify automatically provisions SSL certificate
   - Wait a few minutes for verification
   - HTTPS will be enabled automatically

4. **Test custom domain**:
   - Visit your custom domain
   - Should redirect to HTTPS
   - Should show your application
